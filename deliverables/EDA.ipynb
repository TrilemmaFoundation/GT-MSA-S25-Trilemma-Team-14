    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Price as the Ultimate Signal:**  Bitcoin’s price encapsulates every market force sentiment, liquidity flows, miner economics and institutional moves.  Log-price Z-scores quantify how far price has deviated from its own history, revealing statistically extreme dips (Z ≤ –2σ) and peaks (Z ≥ +2σ) without relying on fragile secondary metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Window Z-Scores Highlight Cycles:**  Rolling Z-scores over 30, 90, 180, 365 and 1461 days simultaneously capture short-term anomalies, intermediate trends and the phase of the 4-year halving cycle providing a unified framework for tactical and strategic timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cycle-Aware Baseline Allocation Shapes:**  Aligning the annual budget shape front-loaded, uniform or back-loaded to the long-term Z-score on January 1 can swing accumulation efficiency (SPD percentile).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Modulation with Budget Integrity:**  Tactical signals adjust daily purchases above or below the baseline, and any deviation triggers proportional rescaling of the remaining days’ allocations to preserve the total yearly budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Finding:**  Despite several on-chain and miner metrics, **log-price Z-scores** emerged as the most interpretable, resilient and future-proof signals for building a cycle-aware dynamic DCA strategy.\n",

    "## 2. Strategy Rationale & Key Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Motivation: A Smarter Way to Dollar-Cost Average  \n",
    "Bitcoin’s volatility can turn a simple DCA into a missed opportunity or a painful mistake. Plain-vanilla DCA pours equal capital into every day, even when prices soar or crash. A smarter approach senses when to deploy extra capital during rare dips and when to hold back in overheated markets, improving long-term accumulation without increasing overall risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The Universe of Metrics: Too Much Noise  \n",
    "Hundreds of raw features from active addresses and miner revenues to MVRV ratios and supply distributions tell many stories about the market. Early exploration confirmed that these signals can lag, contradict one another, or vanish as the market matures and bots arbitrage away inefficiencies. Without a clear anchor, even sophisticated metrics risk becoming distractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Price as the Storyteller  \n",
    "All market forces sentiment swings, institutional flows, mining economics, regulatory shocks ultimately resolve into price. Log-price Z-scores translate this final product into a statistical language that highlights when the market is abnormally cheap or expensive. Multi-window analysis (30d to 1 461d) reveals tactical dips, medium-term trends, and the phase of Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle in one unified framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Crafting the Baseline: Cycle-Aware Allocation  \n",
    "At the start of each calendar year, the long-term Z-score defines the market phase - deep undervaluation, neutral, or euphoria. This phase dictates the baseline budget shape:  \n",
    "- **Front-Loaded** when price is low, seizing early-cycle value  \n",
    "- **Uniform** in balanced or uncertain conditions  \n",
    "- **Back-Loaded** in overheated markets, preserving firepower  \n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle-aware baseline sets the strategic posture for the year, aligning overall risk and reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Breathing Life into the Plan: Dynamic Modulation  \n",
    "Baseline allocation is only the foundation. Daily log-price Z-scores then modulate buys around that plan:  \n",
    "- **Above Baseline** when deep dips beckon\n",
    "- **Below Baseline** when peaks and plateaus warn of overexposure  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time allocation deviates, the remaining days’ weights are rescaled so the total annual budget stays intact. This two-step narrative **cycle-aware baseline** followed by **signal-driven modulation** creates a living strategy that adapts in real time while preserving the discipline of a fixed yearly budget.\n",

    "\n",
    "Multiple metrics were analyzed spanning on-chain activity, network health and valuation indicators, but log-price Z-scores proved the most robust and reliable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **On-Chain Activity:** Metrics like active-address counts and transaction volume carry high noise, generate frequent false positives and often lag or contradict price action.  \n",
    "- **Network Health:** Hash-rate and Difficulty-based Z-scores are inherently delayed by protocol retargets and miner hardware cycles, making them confirmatory rather than predictive for daily timing.  \n",
    "- **Valuation Metrics:** MVRV Z-scores suffer from stale-coin bias and persistent extremes after price reversals, delivering late signals and adding little distinct edge beyond what price history already shows.\n",
